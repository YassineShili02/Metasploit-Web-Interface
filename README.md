🛡️ Metasploit Web Interface – Security Testing Platform
📌 Overview

Metasploit Web Interface is a web-based security testing platform developed using Flask and Metasploit Framework.
The project provides an intuitive web interface that allows users to perform ethical penetration testing by remotely interacting with Metasploit through the RPC protocol (msgrpc).

This application centralizes several common security assessment techniques such as:

Port scanning

SQL Injection testing using SQLMap

Brute-force attacks (SSH, FTP, Telnet, HTTP)

Directory enumeration for web servers

The project is designed for educational and academic purposes, helping students understand offensive security techniques and vulnerability assessment workflows.
